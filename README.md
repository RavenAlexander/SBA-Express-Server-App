# SBA-Express-Server-App
## Recipe Viewer 
This project features a homemade API that tracks sample user data. The idea is that you can view recipes that users have posted as well as rate them, or leave comments.

## Objectives
- Create a server application with Node and Express.
- Create a RESTful API using Express.
- Create Express middleware.
- Use Express middleware.
- Use a template engine to render views with Express.
- Interact with a self-made API through HTML forms.

# Languages and Tools Used
HTML, JS, CSS, NodeJS, Express, EJS (view engine)

# You must download these dependencies:
`npm i express ejs body-parser nodemon`

Run `nodemon server.js` to start the server and view the browser page.

# Blockers:
The app is not fully functional because I didn't have enough time to solve some of the interactive requests, but I do provide code commentary to reflect that. 

## Disclaimer:
If you click on "Download Recipe" button you won't get an actual recipe. Instead you'll get an image of a cat. Enjoy
